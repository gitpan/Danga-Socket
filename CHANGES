1.25: (2004-10-22)

   -- move the syscall.ph require into "package main" rather than stealing
      all its definitions into our namespace.  now other modules can
      use syscall.ph and Danga::Socket at the same time (as long as they're
      also polite and load it into main)  (NOTE: if you know a better way
      to do this, let us know...)

1.24: (2004-10-21)

   -- ability to steal the underlying socket from the Danga::Socket
      object.  this is useful if a caller wants to hold onto the socket
      but destroy the Danga::Socket object (previously the Danga::Socket
      close would close the underlying socket)

1.22: (2004-10-21)

   -- minimal POD docs
   -- first public release
